# build_a_formik_form

This coding project required using npm to install React, Formik, and any other required libraries.  In this activity, the task was to create a login form with validation using Formik.

Your form should include the following:

Email field
Password field
Submit button
Your form should implement the following input validation rules:

If the username or password inputs are empty, display the message "Field required" under the text input.
If the username is not in an email format, display the message "Username should be an email" under the text input.
If the username and password pass the above validations, then display the message "Login Successful" in an alert box.
Your form should implement the following specific details:

The email input field should have the ID emailField
The email error message should be within a div element that has the ID emailError
The password input field should have the ID pswField
The password error message should be within a div element that has an ID pswError
The submit button should have an ID submitBtn

This form still needs some work as time was not on my side this week but I was able to get through it and understood most of it.
